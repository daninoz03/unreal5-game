## Developer Notes

1. **Hub design is key**: Players should always know where they are relative to the spire
2. **Path order doesn't matter**: All three paths should feel complete on their own
3. **Treant is the test**: This fight should feel earned and challenging
4. **Story revelations matter**: The grandmother connection should land emotionally
5. **Don't rush the homes**: Let players absorb the environmental storytelling

---

## Playtesting Questions

- [ ] Do players understand the three-path structure?
- [ ] Is the water puzzle too complex?
- [ ] Do players find all symbol locations?
- [ ] Is the Treant fight appropriately challenging?
- [ ] Does the grandmother revelation have impact?
- [ ] Is the secret area discoverable but not obvious?
