## Area Breakdown

### 1. Entrance / Vista Point
**Purpose**: Establish scale, wonder, and forward goal

**Description**:  
Player emerges from a dark tunnel into dappled sunlight. The path opens onto a rocky overlook with the entire Grove spread below. The Ancient Tree is visible in the distance—the "weenie" drawing them forward.

**Key Elements**:
- Panoramic view of the Grove
- Corruption visibly spreading from the direction of the Ruins
- First Spirit Essence floating near edge (teaches collectibles)
- Path down is clearly marked

**Player Learns**:
- The world is beautiful but sick
- There's a destination (Ancient Tree)
- Glowing things can be collected

---

### 2. Climbing Tutorial
**Purpose**: Teach basic traversal without explicit tutorials

**Description**:  
Natural rock formation with obvious handholds. Player must descend the cliff to continue. Small ledges allow for safe experimentation.

**Key Elements**:
- Clearly climbable surface (golden shimmer when close)
- Multiple descent paths (player choice)
- Spirit Essence on a side ledge (rewards exploration)
- Soft landing area

**Player Learns**:
- How to identify climbable surfaces
- Basic climb/shimmy controls
- Looking around can reveal rewards

---

### 3. Stream Area
**Purpose**: Teach movement flow, introduce environmental traversal

**Description**:  
A gentle stream blocks direct progress. Stepping stones provide a clear path, with an optional rope swing to a harder-to-reach platform.

**Key Elements**:
- Stepping stones (5-6 stones)
- Rope swing (optional path to Spirit Essence)
- Lore Stone #1 near stream bank
- Beautiful environment (calm before tension)

**Key Moment**:  
*As player crosses stream, a Ghost Echo appears briefly—children playing by the water. It fades before player can interact.*

**Player Learns**:
- Environmental traversal
- Rope swing mechanics (optional)
- Lore Stone interaction

---

### 4. Fallen Tree Bridge
**Purpose**: Balance beam tutorial, minor tension

**Description**:  
A massive fallen tree spans a gap. Player must cross carefully—a simple balance beam section.

**Key Elements**:
- Wide enough to not feel punishing
- Optional branching paths along the tree
- Corruption visible below (consequence if they fall—they respawn immediately)
- Spirit Essence in tricky branch location

**Player Learns**:
- Balance/narrow path navigation
- Falling isn't permanent death (but should be avoided)

---

### 5. First Combat Arena
**Purpose**: Teach combat basics in controlled environment

**Description**:  
A small clearing surrounded by natural rock walls. As player enters, Blighted Wolves emerge from the corruption.

**Pre-Combat**:
- Staff acquisition at small shrine on arena edge
- Environmental storytelling (abandoned campsite)
- Clear arena boundaries

**Combat Encounter**:
- 2-3 Blighted Wolves
- Staggered spawning (first one alone, then pair)
- Low damage, telegraphed attacks
- One wolf demonstrates dodge timing clearly

**Post-Combat**:
- Health drop if needed
- Lore Stone #2 reveals itself (was hidden by corruption)
- Path forward opens

**Player Learns**:
- Basic attack combo
- Dodge timing
- Enemy telegraphs
- Combat isn't constant (encounter has clear end)

---

### 6. Beam Puzzle Room
**Purpose**: Introduce puzzle mechanics

**Description**:  
A partially enclosed area with ancient Guardian architecture. A beam of light shines from a crystal above. A moveable mirror can redirect it.

**Puzzle Setup**:
```
    [LIGHT SOURCE]
          │
          │ beam
          ▼
    ┌───────────┐
    │  MIRROR   │ ← Player can rotate 360°
    └─────┬─────┘
          │
          │ reflected beam
          ▼
    [DOOR MECHANISM]
          │
          ▼
       [DOOR OPENS]
```

**Solution**:  
Rotate mirror to redirect beam to door mechanism.

**Key Elements**:
- Single mirror (simple)
- Clear visual feedback (beam visibly moves)
- Immediate result (door opens)
- Lore Stone #3 in the room (optional, slight detour)

**Player Learns**:
- Beam redirection mechanic
- Patience and observation
- How puzzle solutions present themselves visually

---

### 7. Shrine Clearing
**Purpose**: Major story moment, calm before finale

**Description**:  
A beautiful clearing around the Ancient Tree. Guardian shrines surround it. This is the emotional heart of the Grove—where Guardians once gathered.

**Key Elements**:
- The Ancient Tree (massive, beautiful, partially corrupted)
- Multiple Ghost Echoes (Guardians in ceremony)
- Lore Stone #4 (crucial backstory)
- Spirit Essences scattered in the clearing (3-4)
- Guardian Relic location hint (map/inscription pointing to waterfall)
- Exit to Ruins clearly marked

**Major Story Beat**:  
*Player sees a Ghost Echo of the last gathering—Guardians discussing whether to leave. The echo of young Elena is visible among them.*

---

### 8. Waterfall Secret Area (Optional)
**Purpose**: Reward thorough exploration

**Description**:  
Behind the waterfall at the clearing's edge, a hidden path leads to a small cave with the first Guardian Relic.

**Access**:
- Requires noticing the path behind the waterfall
- Short platforming section inside
- Guardian Relic on pedestal
- Additional Spirit Essence (2)

**Player Learns**:
- Exploration is rewarded
- Not everything is on the main path
- Waterfalls hide secrets (classic game design trope)

---

### 9. Exit to Ancient Ruins
**Purpose**: Transition, escalation

**Description**:  
An ancient doorway built into the mountain beyond the clearing. Guardian symbols mark it. The path beyond is darker, more ominous.

**Key Elements**:
- Clear visual shift (natural → architectural)
- Checkpoint (auto-save)
- Environmental storytelling (belongings abandoned at threshold)
- Kira's dialogue about what lies ahead

## Developer Notes

1. **Don't over-explain**: The Grove teaches through doing, not tutorials
2. **Let beauty breathe**: Give players time to absorb the environment
3. **Corruption is creeping**: It should feel like an invasion, not native
4. **The Ancient Tree matters**: Every angle should frame it beautifully
5. **Ghost Echoes are melancholic**: Don't overuse—impact through restraint

## Playtesting Questions

- [ ] Do players understand climbing without prompt?
- [ ] Is the combat encounter appropriately challenging?
- [ ] Do players find the waterfall secret?
- [ ] Is the beam puzzle too easy/hard?
- [ ] Do players feel wonder at the vista?
- [ ] Is the pacing comfortable or rushed?

*"The Sacred Grove is where we hook the player. If they don't care about this forest by the time they leave, we've failed."*
